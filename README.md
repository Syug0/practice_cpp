# 4. How To Start Learning To Code

## ・Tutorial Hell
Even if you master the tutorial, you may not be able to utilize the skills.  
Don't enter tutorial loop.

## ・Project-Based Learning (8:10-)
Suppose you're watching a tutorial on building a calculator.  
When you're taught a program to add two numbers together, it's important to write a new program to subtract two numbers.  
It's crucial to learn from the tutorial and think for yourself at that moment to produce your own output.

## ・Start Small Project

Don't Try to be Perfect!
- Learning
- Iterating
- Improving

---

## Cheat codes
- Having coding buddies
- Sharing progress Online (Github, Qiita, X, etc..)
